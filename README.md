# Text-Adventure
 Implement a text adventure that tells a story of your own making. A package containing fonts and music can be found on the Assets tab. Finding the visual assets will be a part of the exercise. Important: As a group you will create one single story. Square brackets show the requirements for 1/2/3 group members respectively (e.g. 'Create [2/3/4] items' means that you have to create 4 items if you're in a group of three).
